1. Overlays of any kind are not allowed (progress bar, Globed, Mega Hack, etc.).

2. Custom icon texture packs are allowed, but your icon must still look like an icon (no faces or heavily altered designs). Level object-altering texture packs are not allowed.

3. Practice checkpoints cannot be visible in the thumbnail (in-level checkpoints such as platformer checkpoints are allowed).

4. Please show the gameplay of the level, title cards and transitions are not allowed.

5. Particles (such as around orbs and portals) and shaders should be enabled, and LDM should be off in Main Menu > Settings > Help.

6. Do not use a level's built-in LDM.

7. Hitboxes, death effects, and spawn effects are not allowed.

8. You cannot be visibly noclipping, you can noclip as long as the icon is in the main part of the level and isn't in a hitbox.

9. Avoid submitting the first couple percentages of the level if possible, please use an actually good part in the level, show the best/most fun looking part.

10. Use high graphics settings (Main Menu > Settings > Graphics, if you're on mobile use the High Graphics on Mobile mod).

11. If your thumbnail is glitched in any way during the preview (like due to a bug in the mod), do NOT submit it.

12. Avoid submitting thumbnails for random recent tab levels, there are a LOT of thumbnails for the mods to go through and little Timmy levels do not need thumbnails.
